I am a Python developer, and a senior clinical pharmacist with a strong background in hospital pharmacy. 

I leverage Python for analytics, backend development, and automation since late 2018. My focus spans patient care, research, and teaching, driven by a passion for using IT tools to optimize performance and value. 

Colleagues know me as _"a good explainer,"_ _"eager to learn,"_ and adept at _handling challenges_. I thrive under pressure and adapt to change, seeking a dynamic team where I can contribute meaningfully.


## Workplace Value
- Commit to producing high-quality work and passionately support each otherâ€™s growth.
- Share knowledge and skills to enhance the overall capabilities of the team.

- Silver Award for Best Poster at FAPA 2016
- Outstanding Poster Presentation at the Taiwan Pharmaceutical Joint Annual Conference 2021
- Excellent Clinical Teacher at Taiwan Adventist Hospital (2023)
